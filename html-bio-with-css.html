        "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
         demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot 
         foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail 
         in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking 
         from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, 
         when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we 
         like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
         owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures 
         have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters 
         to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he 
         endures pains to avoid worse pains."
